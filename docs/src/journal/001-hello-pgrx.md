# Day 1: Hello pgrx

*Date: 2026-02-19*

## What I was trying to do

<!-- What was the goal? Setting up the project from scratch — what did that involve? -->

## What actually happened

<!-- Did the setup go smoothly? Any friction with pgrx init, Docker, Rust toolchain? -->

## What I learned

<!-- What's the one thing you'd explain to someone starting a pgrx project? -->
<!-- How does pgrx actually turn Rust code into a Postgres extension? -->

## What surprised me

<!-- Anything unexpected about how pgrx works? The build times? The generated SQL? -->

## Questions for later

<!-- What are you still curious about? What do you want to dig into next? -->
